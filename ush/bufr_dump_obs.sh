# Script name:   bufr_dump_obs.sh   Driver for the obs. data dump util
#
# Author:        D.A. Keyser        Org: NP22           Date: 2017-01-10
#
# Abstract: This script is a driver for the all-purpose BUFR observation
#   database tank dump utility, dumpjb.  It's main purpose is to output BUFR
#   data dumps to the appropriate $COMROOT directory and path file naming
#   structure used by the operational NCEP networks.  The dumping of any number
#   of BUFR data types can thus be accomplished for all NCEP networks via a
#   single line in the analyses scripts which executes this driver script.  A
#   secondary purpose (if so requested) is to: 1) run the prepssmi program
#   which will read SSM/I data from one of three possible just-generated BUFR
#   dump sources [FNOC "operational" products, NCEP Neural Net-3 products, or
#   brightness temperatures (the latter will be used to generate products in-
#   line in prepssmi)], reprocess the data (most likely generating superobs),
#   and output the reprocessed data into a BUFR file ("spssmi"); 2) run a
#   series of three programs (dcodcloc, dataqc, datasort) which will read ERS
#   scatterometer data from the just-generated ERS BUFR dump ("erswnd"), do
#   some special reprocessing of these data, and output the reprocessed data
#   into a BUFR file ("erscat"); 3) run the dcodquikscat program which will
#   read Quikscat scatterometer data from the just-generated Quikscat BUFR dump
#   ("qkscat"), do some special reprocessing of these data (most likely
#   generating superobs), and output the reprocessed data into a BUFR file
#   ("qkswnd"); 4) run the dcodquikscat program which will read ASCAT
#   scatterometer data from the just-generated ASCAT BUFR dump ("ascatt"), do
#   some special reprocessing of these data (possibly generating superobs), and
#   output the reprocessed data into a BUFR file ("ascatw"); 5) run the
#   supertmi program which will read TRMM TMI data from the just-generated TRMM
#   TMI BUFR dump ("trmm") and superob these data and output the reprocessed
#   data into a BUFR file ("sptrmm"); 4) run the dcodwindsat program which will
#   read WindSat scatterometer data from the just-generated WindSat BUFR dump
#   ("wndsat"), do some special reprocessing of these data (including possibly
#   generating superobs), and output the reprocessed data into a BUFR file
#   ("wdsatr").  All output SSM/I, ERS, Quikscat, ASCAT, TRMM TMI and WindSat
#   files are written to the same $COMROOT directory and path file naming
#   structure as the original BUFR data dump files; also all five are then
#   ready to be input to subsequent programs (the first four and the sixth to
#   PREPOBS_PREPDATA and the fifth one to GLOBAL_SSI).  Upon completion of the
#   dumping of requested data types, and the completion of the prepssmi, ERS,
#   Quikscat, ASCAT, TRMM TMI and/or WindSat reprocessing programs (if
#   requested), a status file can be generated (by request) and written to the
#   same path as the dump files. The ASCII status file contains a summary of
#   report counts for all requested subtypes that have been dumped.  It also
#   contains information on the return code for each data group dumped.
#
#   It should be noted that this script can output data dumps to any file path
#   location specified by the imported variable "$COMSP".  It is not tied to
#   the production $COMROOT (e.g., /com or /com2) structure, and is thus
#   suitable for non-operational "over-the-counter" type runs.
#
# Script history log:
# 1996-09-27  D.A. Keyser -- Original version for implementation
# 1997-02-19  D.A. Keyser -- A condition code of 4 out of prepssmi will no
#    longer cause a fatal error in this script
# 1997-04-14  D.A. Keyser -- Added optional ERS scatterometer data processing
#    section to this script
# 1999-02-03  D.A. Keyser -- Total y2k compliance as central date (input script
#    positional parameter 1) is now ALWAYS expected to contain a 4-digit year
# 1999-03-08  D.A. Keyser -- The ucl for the datasort program modified since
#    this program now genrates an NCEP-format BUFR output file (copied to /com
#    for IBM PREPDATA program) as well as the previous WMO BUFR file (still
#    used by operational PREPDATA program on Cray); qsub added to execute new
#    version of prepssmi which will generate an NCEP-BUFR spssmi file and copy
#    it to /com for IBM PREPDATA program
# 1999-06-01  D.A. Keyser -- The ucl for the prepssmi program modified since
#    this program now genrates an NCEP-format BUFR output file (copied to /com
#    for PREPDATA program); the ucl for the datasort program modified since
#    this program now generates only an NCEP-format BUFR output file (copied to
#    /com for PREPDATA program); modified to run on IBM SP
# 2000-02-25  D.A. Keyser -- Modified to run on the IBM-SP
# 2000-05-16  D.A. Keyser -- Added hybrid processing option in SSM/I processing
#    (PREPSSMI_PRODTYPE=COMBINATION)
# 2000-06-26  D.A. Keyser -- Added optional Quikscat scatterometer data
#    processing section to this script; input positional parameter "ntype" ($3)
#    is no longer used - all outputs are tied to the imported variable "$COMSP"
#    (ntype remains as a dummy variable)
# 2001-11-02  D.A. Keyser -- Added optional TRMM TMI data processing section to
#    this script
# 2003-08-13  D.A. Keyser -- Checks to see if a dump file qualifies as a
#    "RESTRICTED" data type - if so, changes group to "rstprod" and permission
#    to "640" (if CHGRP_RSTPROD=YES); set-up to list counts by satellite id in
#    output status file copied to /com if they are present in output file that
#    this script greps; method for greping out data counts from dump output
#    files modified such that if dump file in $COMSP is missing or empty, the
#    status file will always stamp out ZERO reports regardless of what was in
#    the dump output files
# 2004-01-15  D.A. Keyser -- Compares AFWA vs. ARINC ACARS report counts in
#    AIRCAR dump and generates a flag file (*aircar_status_flag*) in $COMSP
#    path indicating which type should be processed in subsequent PREPBUFR
#    steps - this allows AFWA ACARS to serve as a backup when ARINC ACARS is
#    down
# 2004-01-20  D.A. Keyser -- Removed all references to "RUC2B" (folding in its
#    00 and 12Z processing with RUC2A)
# 2004-02-20  D.A. Keyser -- Removed logic that handled split QuikSCAT dump
#    processing (qksca1 --> qkswn1 for first 1/2 of dump period, and qksca2 -->
#    qkswn2 for second 1/2 of dump period) - this was originally done to speed
#    up dumps on slower platforms, but this is no longer necessary - assumes
#    only qkscat is dumped and generates reprocessed dump qkswnd from it
# 2006-03-02  D.A. Keyser -- Added logic to grep out the number of Level 2
#    radial wind and reflectivity replications for each subtype from the dump
#    output files and write to the dump status file; imports new script
#    variable "JOB_NUMBER" {currently either 1, 2, or null (default)} which is
#    appended to the name of the dump status file in /com - this allows two
#    unique status files to be written from two different dump jobs for the
#    same network and cycle time (these are later combined into a single status
#    file in the dump post job)
# 2006-06-06  D.A. Keyser -- Added optional WindSat scatterometer data
#    processing section to this script; added new network option "rtma" (Real-
#    Time Mesoscale Analysis); now looks first for external data cards in
#    optional QuikScat, TRMM TMI and WindSat processing and only if not found
#    uses hardwired "herefiles" in this script as the data cards (adds more
#    fexibility)
# 2007-05-25  D.A. Keyser -- Set-up parm cards for bufr_dcodwindsat to superob
#    on 1 degree lat/lon boxes (had been set to not superob); missing "airsev"
#    dump r.c. reduced from 22 to 5 for all NAM and tm03 NDAS network runs;
#    missing MODIS (Aqua/Terra) IR/WV satwnd dump r.c. reduced from 11 to 4 for
#    all NAM and tm03 NDAS network runs
# 2008-05-05  D.A. Keyser -- Handles ASCAT data (including reprocessing); in
#    grep for dump counts to write into status file, can now skip past dump
#    group numbers (i.e., .DUMP_groupN.) which may not have been included in
#    dump in parent driver script, before would stop dump count grep as soon as
#    first dump group that was not processed was hit
# 2008-11-18  D.A. Keyser -- Added lightning data ("lghtng") to the list of
#    dump types which are considered to be restricted when CHGRP_RSTPROD = YES
# 2010-04-16  D.A. Keyser -- Updated the list of dump types which will either
#    have their return code changed from 11 to 4 if they are missing or from 22
#    to 5 if they are missing because they are expected to either OFTEN or
#    ALWAYS be missing; minor changes to account for new dump type ssmisu;
#    minor changes to account for possible dump2 jobs in all networks
#    (currently dump2 runs only in nam and ndas); will not create an empty
#    spssmi dump file if prepssmi processing does not run
# 2012-01-04  D.A. Keyser -- Updated to handle new "rap" (Rapid Refresh)
#    network and its model runs "rap", "rap_p" and "rap_e"; since TAMDAR data
#    (all types) no longer available, missing dumps of types "tamdar"
#    (004.008), "tmdarp" (004.012) and "tmdarc" (004.013) now get dump r.c.
#    reduced from 22 to 5 for all networks and cycle times
# 2012-05-09  D.A. Keyser -- Improved computation time greatly by having each
#    exeuction of this script in a particular job (which normally runs this
#    script in multiple, simultaneous background threads) generate preliminary
#    report count information (by subtype) which will later be used when the
#    status file is generated - rather than waiting until the last execution of
#    this script (which is not threaded) to do so all at once when the status
#    file is generated; now checks to make sure that report dump counts can
#    never exceed the constrained limit of 9999999 in the dump status file
#    listing - in the rare event that a count does exceed this value, it is set
#    to 9999999 in the dump status file and a diagnostic message is posted to
#    the joblog file and to the dump status file
# 2013-01-17  S. Melchior -- Modified code to properly run on WCOSS system. 
#    Replaced all usage of "timex" with "time -p."  Replaced script variables
#    XLFUNIT_n with FORTn (where n is the unit number connected to the filename
#    defined by the variable FORTn) - needed because ifort uses FORTn.   
#    This script is now set to run under ksh shell as the default.
# 2013-12-02  D.A. Keyser -- Imports new environment variable $HOMEobsproc_dump
#    which points to root directory path for dump subdirectories (in production
#    this is normally /nwprod/obsproc_dump.vX.Y.Z where X.Y.Z version number
#    being used, usually the latest); and imports new environment variable
#    $HOMEobsproc_network which points to directory path for network-specific
#    dump subdirectories (in production this is normally
#    /nwprod/obsproc_NETWORK.vX.Y.Z where NETWORK is, e.g., global, nam, rap,
#    rtma, urma, and x.y.z is version number being used, usually the latest) -
#    these replace /nw${envir}.
# 2016-04-22  D.A. Keyser -- Use NCO-established variables to point to root
#    directories for main software components and input/output directories in
#    order to run on WCOSS Phase 1 or Phase 2 (here, $COMROOT which replaces
#    hardwire to "/com"). Use NCO-established variables (presumably obtained
#    from modules) to point to prod utilities:
#      - $GRBINDEX from module grib_util (default or specified version) which
#        replaces executable grbindex in non-versioned, horizontal structure
#        utility directory path defined by imported variable $EXGRBIX.
#    No longer references unused utility scripts getges.sh or setup.sh. Replaced
#    path to prepobs_prepssmi NESDIS land/sea tag (mask) file from non-
#    versioned, horizontal structure utility directory $utilparm to versioned,
#    vertical structure fixed file directory $FIXbufr.
# 2017-01-10  D.A. Keyser
#    - Added ground-based GPS ("gpsipw") and MT-SAPHIR btemps ("saphir") to the
#      list of dump types which are considered to be restricted when
#      CHGRP_RSTPROD = YES.
#      BENEFIT: For "gpsipw", allows temporary logic in obsproc_global.v2.3.0
#               script exglobal_dump.sh.ecf to be removed in
#               obsproc_global.v2.4.0; allows temporary logic in
#               obsproc_nam.v2.2.0 script exnam_dump.sh.ecf to be removed in
#               obsproc_nam.v2.3.0; allows temporary logic in obsproc_rap.v2.2.0
#               script exrap_dump.sh.ecf to be removed in obsproc_rap.v2.3.0;
#               and allows temporary logic in obsproc_cdas.v2.1.0 script
#               excdas_dump.sh.ecf to be removed in obsproc_cdas.v2.2.0.
#    - Corrected logic error which prevented the number of actual reports from
#      being printed in a diagnostic joblog message when the number of reports
#      exceeded the status file limit of 9999999 for dump group mnemonics with
#      less than 6 characters.
# 2017-11-14 JWhiting 
#    - Fixed bug exposed when fractional center date/time values are provided
#      in positional parameter $1 (cendat); various logic tries to parse the
#      value to pick off the whole number hour value, but this fails when
#      fractional values are sent; added new variable icendat variable which
#      uses ${variable%pattern} shell syntax to truncate decimal content.
#    - added rtma_ru_dump to tests on job name to set run name for status report
#      output); also added leading wildcard ("*") to all job name tests to
#      account for implementation parallel runs which include a leading "p" in
#      the job names.
#    - set default value for imported shell variable prepssmi to NO
#      NOTE: Logic in this script references prepobs_prepssmi.sh script which
#       was never ported to the current WCOSS systems.  The imported shell
#       variable prepssmi is always set to NO in all production runs, but if it
#       were ever to be set to YES, this script would fail.
#    - set default value for imported shell variable prepersd to NO
#      Note: ERS scatterometer wind reprocessing executables (dcodcloc, dataqc,
#       datasort) have not been ported to current WCOSS systems and would fail
#       if invoked.
# 2018-12-07  C. Hill -- Each subtype of FM42-based sonde data (002.00[1-5]) is
#      paired with its corresponding subtype of BUFR-based data (002.10[1-5])
#      within the 'pattern' list of potentially missing subtypes (i.e. tanks).
#
# 2021-03-09 SMelchior -- Included gpsro among the data types whose dump files
#    are restricted.
#
# Usage: bufr_dump_obs.sh  yyyymmddhh hh<.hh> ntype dgrp1 dgrp2 ... dgrpN
#
#   Input script positional parameters:
#     yyyymmddhh<.hh> $1  - center of time window for dump
#     hh<.hh>         $2  - radius of time window for dump
#     ntype           $3  - reserved, currently has no meaning
#     dgrp1           $4  - data group 1 - see dumpjb for valid data group list
#     dgrp2               - data group 2
#     ...                ...
#     dgrpN           $#  - data group N
#      NOTE: If data group 1 is set to the string 'null', no data dumps
#            will be performed regardless of the remaining data groups
#            listed.  However, if "STATUS=YES" (see below) a status
#            file containing reports counts/info from all previous runs
#            of this script by a particular parent script will be
#            generated and all outputs from previous runs of this script
#            in the various $DATA/job${DUMP_NUMBER} directories will be
#            combined into the $DATA directory.  This is currently used
#            when running this script in simultaneous background jobs -
#            after all of the background jobs have completed, a final
#            job is run with this string set to null.
#
#   Imported Shell Variables:
#     (NOTE: These do not include most of the variables listed in the
#            dumpjb docblock that are specific to dumpjb - see dumpjb script
#            for a list of the dumpjb variables)
#
#     These must ALWAYS be exported from the parent script --
#
#     COMROOT       Root to input/output "com" directory (in production,
#                   normally either "/com" for WCOSS  Phase 1 or "/com2" for
#                   WCOSS Phase 2)
#     DUMP_NUMBER - string indicating the number associated with this
#                   particular run of this script (needed when this script is
#                   run in simultaneous background jobs)
#     DATA        - string indicating the initial (temporary) directory path
#                   to output data destination
#                   (NOTE: Each particular run of this script will write
#                          output data to $DATA/job$DUMP_NUMBER directory;
#                          only the final run with STATUS=YES will combine
#                          outputs for individual runs into $DATA directory.
#                          This allows this script to run in simultaneous
#                          background jobs.)
#     NET         - string indicating system network (i.e., "arc", "gfs",
#                   "nam", "gdas", "rap" (replacing "ruc"), "rucs", "dump",
#                   "rtma") --
#                   points to proper data card file for programs executed here
#                   and to echo in dump status file
#                   NOTE: NET is changed to gdas in the parent Job script for
#                         the gdas RUN (was gfs - NET remains gfs for gfs RUN)
#     COMSP       - string indicating the final directory/filename path to
#                   output data destination
#                   (e.g., "$COMROOT/nam/prod/ndas.20160428/ndas.t12z.")
#                   {NOTE: If the imported variable "SENDCOM" (see below)
#                          is "NO", then COMSP is hardwired to the string
#                          "$DATA/"}
#     tmmark      - string indicating hour for center time for dump
#                   relative to the analysis time, it is a qualifier in the
#                   output data dump file names (e.g., "tm12", "tm09",
#                   "tm06", "tm03", "tm00")
#     $HOMEbufr_dump - Formerly $HOMEobsproc_dump prior to WCOSS2. String
#                      indicating root directory path to dump subdirectories
#                      (in production this is normally
#                      $NWROOT/bufr_dump.vX.Y.Z where X.Y.Z is version
#                      number being used, usually the latest)
#     $HOMEobsproc   - Formerly $HOMEobsproc_network prior to WCOSS2.
#                      String indicating directory path to network-specific
#                      dump subdirectories (in production this is normally
#                      $NWROOT/obsproc.vX.Y.Z where X.Y.Z is version number
#                      being used, usually the latest)
#
#     These will be set to their default value in this script if not exported
#      from the parent script --
# 
#     JOB_NUMBER  - string indicating the number associated with this
#                   particular dump job (needed when the overall network dump
#                   is split into more than one dump job)
#                   Default is "" (null)
#     STATUS      - string: if = 'YES' will generate a status file which is
#                   written to the same path as the dump files.  This is
#                   written out after all dump files have been created, and
#                   contains both report counts (by subtype) and return code
#                   information for each data group dumped.
#                           if = 'NO' will not generate a status file but will
#                   generate preliminary report count information (by subtype)
#                   which will later be used when the status file is generated.
#                           if = 'NEVER' will not generate either a status file
#                   nor preliminary report count information (by subtype)
#                   generated (i.e., a status file is not being generated by
#                   the executing job).
#                   Default is "YES"
#                   NOTE: If this script is executed more than one time by
#                         the parent script, "STATUS" should be imported as
#                         "NO" unless this is the FINAL execution of this 
#                         script.  The status file will always contain
#                         information from all previous runs of this
#                         script by a particular parent script. The last
#                         execution of this script MUST ALWAYS set STATUS=YES
#                         since this combines output from all previous
#                         executions of this script which write to the
#                         directory $DATA/job${DUMP_NUMBER} . 
#     envir       - string indicating environment under which job runs
#                   (either "prod" or "test")
#                   Default is "prod"
#     DUMP        - string indicating path for dump script file

#         ${COMSP}dgrpX.${tmmark}.bufr_d
#     (See above for usual string appearance for $COMSP and $tmmark; dgrpX
#      is input positional parameter mnemonic associated with a particular
#      data group)
#
#     prepobs_prepssmi may or may not be run (depending on imported shell
