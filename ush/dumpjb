# Script name:   dumpjb      Dump script to get data from BUFR tanks
#
# RFC contact:  Melchior    Org: EMC         Date: 2021-08-28
#
# Abstract: The dumpjb script is an all-purpose dump utility for time
#   windowing, geographical filtering, eliminating duplicates, and applying
#   corrections to, BUFR observation database tank data.  The script is driven
#   by script parameters which specify the time window and the list of data to
#   dump.  Data to dump is indicated by either mnemonic references to one or
#   more individual data types and/or groups of data types (where a data type
#   is defined as a sequence of one or more BUFR message types/subtypes), or by
#   a single BUFR message type, optionally followed by one or more BUFR message
#   subtypes for the BUFR message type.  Several imported script variables
#   determine other characteristics of the dump, such as geographical
#   filtering, more selective time windowing, skipping over specific BUFR
#   message type/subtypes, adding BUFR message type/subtypes, choosing the path
#   to the database tanks based on the data type, and the final presentation
#   and form of the dumped datasets.  Each data group requested as a parameter,
#   generates one or more process threads which each dump one data type.  The
#   script is setup so all the process threads from all the data groups can be
#   either: run in parallel under mpmd thus allowing threads to run across
#   cores or run serially.
#
# Script history log:
# 1996-09-25  J. Woollen  Original version for implementation
# 1996-10-28  J. Woollen  Added variable DUPC to allow duplicate checking to be
#     disabled; added additional error checking and modified UCL for DUMPMD
#     program
# 1996-11-27  J. Woollen  Records the status of each individual subtype dump,
#     along with the status of each data group dump; two new executables;
#     DUPMAR and CHKBFR, added
# 1996-12-11  J. Woollen  Added GMT dump time to DUMPMD standard input so it
#     can write this into the BUFR dump file
# 1997-01-22  J. Woollen  Added new executable DUPAIR to dup-check combinations
#     of aircraft data; added new executable EDTBFR to process manual SDM
#     hold/purge flags and data reject list flags in sdmedit text file; added
#     new executable QUIPC to process marine q.c. information in quips text
#     file
# 1997-02-19  J. Woollen  Protect DUPAIR-EDTBFR-QUIPC from zero length inputs 
# 1998-02-12  D. Keyser   Check for zero-byte tanks that actually exist, if
#     found sleeps for 30 seconds and checks again - if still empty gives up
#     (gets around problems that tanks may be momentarily "empty" when tranjb
#     is writing to them)
# 1999-02-02  B. Facey    Modified to interface with the Y2K compliant dump
#     codes, it will accept a date with either a 2 or 4 digit year and will
#     resolve it to a BUFR database directory name containing a 4 digit year
# 1999-07-14  L. Sager/D. Keyser Updated to run on IBM; added poe option; added
#     geographical filtering via new executable GEOFIL
# 1999-09-22  B. Facey    Updated to dump monthly BATHY data
# 2000-02-10  D. Keyser   Added option to override the input script positional
#     parameter "radius of time window" for a particular BUFR type/subtype in
#     the data group list, here both the earliest and latest requested report
#     times in the dump are represented by offset values from the center time
#     (negative value meaning prior to center time and positive value meaning
#     after center time - note that the magnitudes for these can be different);
#     added option to skip the dumping of a particular BUFR type/subtype in the
#     data group list
# 2000-03-06  D. Keyser   Modified to remove file "fort.20" after BUFR_EDTBFR
#     program has ended and before BUFR_QUIPC program has begun, both programs
#     read input text data from unit 20 (sdmedit for BUFR_EDTBFR and quips for
#     BUFR_QUIPC) and cases have occurred where the sdmedit file was available
#     but the quips file was missing resulting in BUFR_QUIPC reading the
#     sdmedit data and generating read error messages missing.
# 2000-07-25  C. C. Magee Dup-check executable DUPSST will now run for new BUFR
#     type 012, subtype 012 (NAVY hi-res. SST data)
# 2000-08-01  D. Keyser   Modified reading of dumplist file to allow lines up
#     to 500 columns (was 132) and to allow dumplist file to contain comments
#     (i.e., descriptions of message types/subtypes that used to be in the
#     docblock of this script)
# 2000-09-05  D. Keyser   Modified to remove a potential fatal error which
#     could occur if a BUFR database tank exists but has size zero (either
#     through some actual occurrence or because a tank is suddenly offline due
#     to a system glitch), fortunately, this situation has not occurred in
#     operations since the dump jobs were converted to the IBM SP
# 2000-09-25  D. Keyser   Modified to correct a problem which will cause an
#     abort if the parent script exports the variable to override the offset
#     value from the center time for a particular BUFR type (TTT) and subtype
#     (SSS)
# 2000-10-12  D. Keyser   Modified to initialize all output data dump files
#     (for a particular BUFR type and subtype) in the working directory as null
#     files prior to any processing, if there is a failure in a particular dump
#     thread, the empty output file will still be in the list of files read by
#     BUFR_CHKBUFR (will write out zero reports dumped for that subtype)
# 2000-12-14  D. Keyser   Modified to add new parameters "DTIM_earliest_@@@@"
#     and "DTIM_latest_@@@@", where "@@@@" is a valid group name from the
#     dumplist, this allows the earliest and latest time in the dump window to
#     be modified for all BUFR types/subtypes in a group; added new script
#     variables representing each of the programs that are executed by this
#     script
# 2001-03-08  D. Keyser   Modified to set the root directory tree for the path
#     to the script's temporary work files (TMPDIR) to /gpfstmp/$USER, rather
#     than /nfstmp/$USER, for checkout runs when the parent script has not
#     modified TMPDIR from its global value (assumed to be either "/nfstmp" or
#     "/gpfstmp"), this change does not affect production runs, which set
#     TMPDIR to $DATA, or checkout runs where the parent script modifies TMPDIR
#     from its global value prior to executing this script (this change is
#     necessary because quotas placed on /nfstmp have resulted in the failure
#     of some large data dump checkout jobs due to a lack of disk space on
#     /nfstmp
# 2002-01-15  D. Keyser   Dup-check executable BUFR_DUPSAT will now run for new
#     BUFR type 021, subtype 041 (NESDIS GOES imager clear radiances)
# 2002-03-19  D. Keyser   Modified to add call to new dup-checking executable
#     BUFR_DUPS1B for BUFR 1B satellite dumps in BUFR type 021, subtypes 21-25
#     (for HIRS-2, MSU, AMSU-A, AMSU-B and HIRS-3, respectively); modified to
#     call new dup-checking executable BUFR_DUPRAD for superobed NEXRAD radial
#     wind dumps in BUFR type 006, subtype 001; will no longer attempt to
#     execute BUFR_GEOFIL if user program wishes to dump the entire globe; will
#     no longer attempt to execute BUFR_DUPAIR if the input dump file(s) is/are
#     not one of the following types: AIREP, PIREP, AMDAR; passes geographical
#     filtering parameters into the duplicate checking program via Fortran unit
#     11 (currently, BUFR_DUPS1B, is the only one which reads this, since
#     geographical filtering must be performed here rather than in BUFR_GEOFIL
#     which process these BUFR compressed data dumps); modified to work
#     properly in CRON job runs where the global variable $TMPDIR is not set -
#     the script sets it to /nfstmp in this case; added several new imported
#     script variables to override operational program executables for
#     duplicate checking, SDM and quips quality mark processing, and file
#     merging and checking
# 2002-04-29  D. Keyser   Modified to clear out any "current" XLF variables
#     associated with Fortran unit numbers since the executables in this script
#     do not call the utility script prep_step (which performs this function)
#     prior to their execution, this will prevent the occurrence of unit number
#     conflicts in the event that a unit number used by a program in this
#     script was also used by a program executed earlier in a parent script
# 2002-06-25  L. Sager    Added option to dump the bathymetric data, BUFR type
#     031, from daily tanks if the BUFR subtype is .ge. 100 (if the BUFR
#     subtype is .lt. 100,  dumping will occur from the monthly tanks) - this
#     change is needed to handle the new data type "TOPEX altimeter processed
#     qc data" which will be stored in daily tanks
# 2002-11-20  D. Keyser   Modified to recognize when the program BUFR_DUPAIR
#     stops abnormally - an abnormal stop in this program will now cause this
#     script to exit with return code 99, but not until it has finished
#     processing all data types
# 2003-08-19  D. Keyser   Treats input tanks that do not have READ permission
#     as MISSING (these tanks contain RESTRICTED data)
# 2004-04-13  D. Keyser   Includes E-ADAS (004.006) in DUPAIR dup-checking;
#     now processes subtypes in the order they are listed for a group mnemonic
#     in dumplist, rather than always in ascending order (regardless of how
#     they were arranged) (done by calling filenames "01_xxx.aaa",
#     "02_xxx.bbb", etc. instead of "xxx.aaa" & "xxx.bbb") (002.009 needs to be
#     read last by W3UNPKB7 but now with new 002.011 and 002.013 in "proflr"
#     this would no longer be the case without this change); echos group name
#     into fort.30 to be read by CHKBFR for new listing of counts by sat. id;
#     no longer executes "timex" command prior to poe command (necessary with
#     conversion to IBM Frost/Snow); will not execute BUFR_QUIPC unless one or
#     more dumps in group incl. 001.001-001.005; will not execute BUFR_EDTBFR
#     unless one or more dumps in group incl. 000.*, 001.*, 002.*, 004.*,
#     005.*; if either BUFR_EDTBFR or BUFR_QUIPC does not complete properly,
#     this script now returns with r.c.=99 (before ignored any problems in
#     these two scripts); mesonet data in BUFR type 255 now uses DUPMAR
#     followed by DUPCOR rather than DUPCOR only for duplicate checking; if
#     final return code for dump is 22, script now copies dump file to $DATA
#     even though it will contain no reports (it should, however, contain
#     dictionary messages and the center and dump time messages), done so
#     BUFRLIB will not complain that file is null when CHKBFR opens it (Note:
#     if no database files yet exist w/i requested date range, checks
#     availability of database file from previous day and uses it so dump file
#     will have dictionary and dummy messages and thus not be null) (before,
#     r.c.=22 resulted in no copy of dump file to $DATA); fixed bug: test on
#     LALO = 0 fails when LALO includes spaces; added quotes (discovered by J.
#     Whiting)
# 2004-04-20  D. Keyser   Modified to correct error that occurs if parent
#     script exports FORM=copy, in this case dumpjb was creating dump files
#     with the naming convention "nn_ttt.sss" [where "nn" is the dump order
#     index (01-99), ttt is the BUFR type and sss is the BUFR subtype] - this
#     change restores the dump file name to just "ttt.sss"
# 2005-09-22  D. Keyser   All satellite types previously using dup-check code
#     BUFR_DUPS1B now use BUFR_DUPSAT (since latter can now handle compressed
#     BUFR messages), all references to BUFR_DUPS1B, including script variable
#     S1BX, removed; removed reference to scratch file scr.uncompressed_* in
#     script executing BUFR_CHKBFR because it is no longer used by this
#     program; added new script variable "TIME_TRIM", when imported as "off" it
#     will cause the particular dup-checking code to NOT perform any time
#     window trimming of subsets in the BUFR file being read by the dup-
#     checking code, regardless of the requested time window (the default is
#     "on", time window trimming will occur, as before, if "TIME_TRIM" is not
#     exported to this script), NOTE: because of a bug in all dup-check codes
#     except BUFR_DUPCOR and BUFR_DUPSAT, TIME_TRIM=off currently applies ONLY
#     to these two dup-check codes; removed copy of LALO (lat/lon filtering
#     boundary) into fort.11 for dup-check codes (was used only by
#     BUFR_DUPS1B); all types using dup-check code BUFR_DUPSAT are now
#     geographically filtered in BUFR_DUPSAT when such filtering is requested
#     (previously all types using BUFR_DUPSAT] were geographically filtered
#     using BUFR_GEOFIL while all types using the now obsolete dup-checking
#     code BUFR_DUPS1B where geographically filtered in BUFR_DUPS1B - it is
#     more efficient, computationally, to do this filtering within the dup-
#     check code), all other types continue to use BUFR_GEOFIL if geographic
#     filtering is requested
# 2006-01-31  D. Keyser   Script logic for executing $RADX is expanded out
#     because previous structure caused $RADX to be skipped, on rare occasions
#     for reasons unknown, when $RADX was compiled with the 29 November 2005
#     version of BUFRLIB (BUFRLIB implemented 31 January 2006)
# 2006-02-01  D. Keyser   Level 2 radial wind or reflectivity types are in
#     1-hour tanks to speed up their dump processing time (because there is
#     SO MUCH DATA), to further speed up their dump processing time, logic is
#     added which allows them to skip the BUFR_DUMPMD processing step - e.g. if
#     the dump window spans two days only one day's database file is considered
#     (the approriate day with data within the requested time window), also the
#     generation of two "dummy" messages containing the dump center and
#     processing times, resp. at the top of the dump file is moved from
#     BUFR_DUMPMD to BUFR_COMBFR (this applies to ALL types of data when script
#     variable FORM is NOT set to "copy", if FORM is set to "copy" then
#     BUFR_DUMPMD must still be run for all types because it will write the
#     dummy messages to the dump file since BUFR_COMBFR does not run in this
#     case); added new script variable DUMPMD which controls the execution of
#     BUFR_DUMPMD (there may be cases where BUFR_DUMPMD need not run in order
#     to save computation time (e.g., Level 2 radial wind or reflectivity types
#     in 1-hour tanks) - before BUFR_DUMPMD always ran in every thread), see
#     comments about script variable DUMPMD in remarks section below; checks to
#     see if file fort.60 exists after BUFR_CHKBFR completes - this indicates
#     that BUFR_CHKBFR completed properly, if the file does not exist, dumpjb
#     exits AT THE END with status code 99 which will cause calling script/job
#     to FAIL (prior to this an improper completion of BUFR_CHKBFR could result
#     in dumpjb continuing normally but causing problems later); $pos is now
#     incremented only for those dump subtypes in a group mnemonic that are not
#     set to be skipped by parent script {before $pos was incremented for each
#     subtype in group mnemonic prior to test for skipping subtype(s)}; if
#     BUFR_DUMPMD does not run but BUFR_GEOFIL does, copies original database
#     tank to nominal working directly location before feeding into BUFR_GEOFIL
#     because BUFR_GEOFIL writes output back into this file (and can't
#     overwrite database tank!); no longer copies output file from BUFR_GEOFIL
#     to $DEST/$FILO, it is not necessary and wastes time; after BUFR_COMBFR
#     now moves fort.50 to $DATA/$NAME.$FORM rather than copies it (to save
#     time); new BUFR type 12 subtypes 017 and 018 (AVHRR physical SST
#     retrievals) defined to use dup-check code BUFR_DUPSST; script variable
#     TIME_TRIM=off now applies to all dup-check codes (had only applied to
#     dup-check codes BUFR_DUPCOR and BUFR_DUPSAT); includes new Canadian AMDAR
#     (004.009) in types of aircraft reports that are dup-checked by
#     BUFR_DUPAIR
# 2006-10-10  D. Keyser   Now tests checkout runs for cases where global value
#     of TMPDIR is set to /stmp, in which case it resets TMPDIR to /stmp/$USER
#     (if /stmp not found, then tests for TMPDIR set to /gpfstmp and resets it
#     to /gpfstmp/$USER, as before), needed because new Mist machine has
#     replaced /gpfstmp with /stmp
# 2007-06-13  D. Keyser   Accounts for (new) option of a mask file in imported
#     script variable LALO
# 2010-12-10  D. Keyser   Added logic to execute the new cross-tank duplicate-
#     check program BUFR_DUPSHP when dumping from BUFR tanks b001/xx001 and
#     b001/xx013 (time-windowed data from both tanks must be present to invoke
#     this); updated to handle the dumping of Tail Doppler Radar winds which
#     will be present in the new tank b006/xx070 in the near future; if the
#     initial duplicate check run is BUFR_DUPMAR, checks for the existence of a
#     file named $DIRD/$FILO.fort.60 upon its completion and if found will
#     execute a second duplicate check run BUFR_DUPCOR (if a second dup-check
#     run is not already specified) (means BUFR_DUPMAR encountered reports from
#     > 1 embedded BUFR table and thus not all duplicates could be removed by
#     it - BUFR_DUPCOR will complete the duplicate checking
# 2012-12-02  J. Woollen  Initial port to WCOSS - updated TMPDIR default;
#     added ksh specification.
# 2013-01-22  J. Whiting  Final WCOSS port: trapped POE=on option, w/ printed 
#     notice and graceful exit (this option not currently tested on WCOSS); 
#     replaced XLF logical unit number clearing w/ appropriate FORTxx logic.
# 2014-02-04  D. Keyser   "DUEX" (path to directory containing dump
#     executables) no longer defaults to /nwprod/exec but rather to
#     $HOMEobsproc_dump/exec, and one of the three variables
#     "obsproc_dump_ver", "HOMEobsproc_dump", or "DUEX" itself must be defined
#     coming in or this script will exit abnormally with return code 99.
#     "DFIX" (path to directory bufr_dumplist fixed file) no longer defaults to
#     /nwprod/fix but rather to $HOMEobsproc_shared_bufr_dumplist/fix, and one
#     of the four variables "obsproc_shared_bufr_dumplist_ver",
#     "HOMEobsproc_shared_bufr_dumplist", "DFIX" itself,  or "LIST" (which
#     remains defined as the complete path to, and including, the bufr_dumplist
#     fixed file) must be defined coming in or this script will exit abnormally
#     with return code 99.
# 2014-02-18  D. Stokes  Update default temporary directory location in response
#     to fileset changes on WCOSS.  Clean up related logic and remove references
#     to /gpfstmp and /nfstmp which had been used on systems since retired.
# 2014-03-16  D. Stokes  Remove default TMPDIR setting.  Script will fail with
#     status 99 if TMPDIR is referenced but not imported.
# 2014-06-24  D. Keyser  Added option to append one or more additional BUFR
#     type/subtypes (beyond that defined in the bufr_dumplist fixed file) to a
#     data group mnemonic or a data group message type/subtype specified in the
#     script parameters.  This is done via new imported environment variable
#     $ADD_<DGRP>, where DGRP is either the group mnemonic to dump or the BUFR
#     message type (depending upon how the dumpjb script parameters are setup).
#     Added option to override imported value for TANK for either an entire
#     data group mnemonic/BUFR message type {done via new imported environment
#     variable $TANK_<DGRP>, where DGRP is either the group mnemonic to dump or
#     the BUFR message type (depending upon how the dumpjb script parameters
#     are setup)}; or for a specific BUFR type/subtype within a data group
#     mnemonic or a data group message type/subtype specified in the script
#     parameters (done via new imported environment variable $TANK_<TTTSSS>,
#     where TTT is the BUFR message type and SSS is the BUFR message subtype). 
# 2015-06-16  S. Melchior  Includes types MDCRS/ARINC (004.004) and MDCRS/AFWA
#     (004.007) in bufr_dupair dup-checking.
# 2015-07-27  S. Melchior  Includes new types Korean AMDAR aircraft (from BUFR)
#     (004.011) and catch-all AMDAR aircraft (from BUFR) (004.103) in
#     bufr_dupair dup-checking.
# 2016-04-22  D. Keyser  No longer references unused utility script mpmd.sh.
#     Uses form of unix date command to replace executable ndate in hardwired
#     non-versioned, horizontal structure utility directory path.
# 2016-08-15  D. Keyser  Added mesonet reports (in BUFR type 255) to types
#     which will be processed by BUFR_EDTBFR.
# 2017-02-20  D. Stokes  Updated to run on Cray-XC40 as well as IBM iDataPlex.
#     - Determines current system (and phase if necessary) based on environment
#       variable SITE and/or NCO utility getsystem.pl.
#     - TMPDIR is no longer a required imported variable for a developer run if
#       DATA_DUMPJB is not imported.  If TMPDIR is needed but not yet set, a 
#       a suitable location will be assigned based on the system type and phase.
#       Variable DTMPDIR can also be passed in if the developer wants to
#       override the default location but has trouble running LSF jobs when 
#       they have set TMPDIR. (currently an issue with bash on luna and surge)
#     - Variable "MPMD" no longer points to an mpmd utility script.  Instead it
#       is used in place of old variable "POE" to toggle mpmd processing.
#     - MPMD=on is allowed for Cray-XC40 runs that utilize compute nodes, but
#       will be changed to MPMD=off if dumpjb was called by a process already
#       running under ALPS.
#     - BACK=on is disabled for Cray-XC40 runs.
#     - Module prod_envir is used to set DCOMROOT if not imported.
#     - New variable DUMPJBprocdate can be set to an artificial time stamp to be
#       stored as the "processing time" in the second dummy message of output
#       dump files.  (Intended for use when validating of upgrades only!)
#     - Modified dump thread script template to preserve intended DUPE2 settings
#       when more than one message type is requested in a single dumpjb call.
#     - Unset DUMMY_MSGS after COMX completes for current data group so that it
#       is not defined prematurely when processing a subsequent data group.
# 2017-08-30  D. Stokes  Enabled MPMD option for IBM iDataPlex (requires cfp).
#       Also modified TMPDIR patterns to recognize new Cray-XC40 filesystems
#       (/gpfs/hps2 and /gpfs/hps3 in addition to /gpfs/hps).  The default
#       TMPDIR location for developer runs on Cray-XC40 is now on the /gpfs/hps3
#       filesystem rather than /gpfs/hps.
# 2018-05-04  Y. Ling  Added VIIRS SST mesgtyp/subtyp 012/023, 012/024 012/025 for 
#       setting the DUPE1 and DUPE2 parameters.
# 2018-08-29  JWhiting  Updated to run on Dell-p3 platforms: 
#     - added logic to detect Dell-p3 system and initialize Modules;
#     - disabled exact matching of Dell-p3 module versions (LMOD_EXACT_MATCH=no);
#     - added default value for TMPDIR on Dell-p3 systems;
#     - added checks for Dell-p3 user temporary directory filesystems.
# 2020-03-09  SPA Update to have TANK, EPRM, QPRM default to Dell-p3 directory
#       structure
# 2020-08-20  S. Melchior  Added cross-tank duplicate checking logic to 
#       remove TAC-feed content that is duplicated by BUFR-feed observations;
#       calls new FORTRAN program bufr_dupsyp (SYPX). Duplicate checking is
#       set up to support restricted synoptic reports (msg/sub types
#       000/000 vs 000/100), fixed non-restricted synoptic reports (msg/sub
#       types 000/001 vs 000/101), and mobile non-restricted synoptic reports
#       (msg/sub types 000/002 vs 000/102).
#     - Added logic to copy bufr_dumplist to $COMROOT for each dump cycle run.
# 2020-08-20 JWhiting  Added cross-tank duplicate checking logic to remove 
#       TAC-feed (Traditional Alphanumeric Code) content that is duplicated by 
#       BUFR-feed observations; calls new FORTRAN program bufr_duptac (TACX),
#       and is enabled by DUPC_TAC (default:on; import DUPC_TAC!=on to disable).
#       Duplicate checking is set up to support fixed and drifting buoy data
#       streams (ie, msg/sub types 001/003 vs 001/103; & 001/002 vs 001/102).
# 2021-04-12  J. Dong  Updated to run on Dell-p3 as well as Cray-XC40 and IBM
#       iDataPlex.  BACK=on is disapbled for Dell-p3 runs.  MPMD=on is allowed
#       for Dell-p3 runs that utilize computer notes, but will be changed to
#       MPMD=off if dumpjb was called by a process already running under ALPS.
#     - Added cross-tank duplicate checking logic to remove the duplications
#       among the TAC-feed and BUFR-feed observations; calls updated FORTRAN
#       program bufr_dupshp (SHPX). Duplicate checking is set up to support
#       restricted/unrestricted ship reports (msg/sub types 001/001 vs
#       001/013 vs 001/101 vs 001/113).
#     - Added cross-tank duplicate checking logic to remove the duplications
#       among the TAC-feed and BUFR-feed observations; calls new FORTRAN
#       program bufr_dupcman (CMANX). Duplicate checking is set up to support
#       Land-based C-MAN reports (msg/sub types 001/004 vs 001/104).
#     - Moved logic to copy bufr_dumplist to $COMROOT for each dump cycle run 
#       to network specific dump scripts.  Added diagnostic print to dump log
#       file to indicate which bufr_dumplist file was used.
# 2021-??-??  S. Melchior - Rough modifications to include WCOSS2 (Cray-EX)
# 2021-08-28  D. Stokes - Rough modifications to run on WCOSS2 (Cray-EX) only
#     - Incomplete list of changes:
#       - Removed option BACK for background threads
#       - Removed module loads 
#       - Removed attempt to set TMPDIR if it is needed but not set due to
#         project-specific ptmp and stmp locations on WCOSS2

# Usage: dumpjb  yyyymmddhh<.hh> hh<.hh> dgrp1 dgrp2 dgrp3 ... dgrpN
#
#   Script parameters:
#     yyyymmddhh<.hh> - center of time window for dump, where
#                        yyyy  is center time year
#                          mm  is center time month
#                          dd  is center time day
#                          hh  is center time hour
#                       <.hh>  is optional fraction of an hour (defaults to 0)
#
#     hh<.hh>         - radius of time window for dump (i.e., the dump time
#                       window would be hh<.hh> hours PRIOR to yyyymmddhh<.hh>
#                       through hh<.hh> hours AFTER yyyymmddhh<.hh>)

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------
#   %%
#      - When data groups dgrp1, dgrp2, dgrp3, ... , dgrpN are denoted as N
#        different mnemonics, each represents either a single BUFR message
#        type/subtype that is to be dumped or a sequence of multiple BUFR
#        message types/subtypes that are to be dumped, as defined in the
#        bufr_dumplist fixed file ($LIST).  A mnemonic can be any alphanumberic
#        string up to 6 characters in length with the exception of 3-character
#        numeric strings. (See $LIST for the current valid list of mnemonics.)
#           Examples:
#                dgrp1 = synop
#                      (defined as a single BUFR type/subtype 000/001, dump
#                       only this type)
#                dgrp2 = adpupa
#                      (defined as a sequence of BUFR types/subtypes 002/001,
#                       002/002, 002/003, 002/004, 002/005 and 004/005, dump
#                       all of these types/subtypes)
#                dgrp3 = vsnds
#                      (defined as a sequence of BUFR types/subtypes 003/001,
#                       003/002, 003/003, 003/010, 003/101, 003/102 and
#                       003/104, dump all of these types/subtypes)
#
#        This will be referred to as the "data group mnemonic" case from here
#        on.
#        (See $LIST for the current valid list of mnemonics.)
#
#      - When data group dgrp1 is denoted as a 3-character numeric string and
#        there is only one data group (i.e., dgrpN = dgrp1), dgrp1 represents a
#        BUFR message type as defined in the bufr_dumplist fixed file ($LIST).
#        In this case, all BUFR message subtypes in dgrp1 will be dumped.
#           Example:
#                dgrpN = dgrp1 = 001
#                      (dump all BUFR subtypes in BUFR type 001; i.e.,
#                       subtypes 001, 002, 003, 004, 005, 006, 007, 008, 009,
#                       010, 011, 012 and 013)
#
#        This likewise will be referred to as the "data group mnemonic" case
#        from here on.
#        (See $LIST for the current valid list of mnemonics.)
#
#      - When data group dgrp1 is denoted as a 3-character numeric string and
#        there is more than one data group (i.e., dgrpN > dgrp1), dgrp1
#        represents a BUFR message type as defined in the bufr_dumplist fixed
#        file ($LIST) and dgrp2, ... , dgrpN represent the N-1 BUFR message
#        subtypes in BUFR message type dgrp1 that will be dumped.  No other
#        BUFR message subtypes in dgrp1 will be considered in this situation.
#           Example:
#                dgrp1 = 001
#                dgrp2 = 003
#                dgrp3 = 010
#                dgrpN = dgrp4 = 013
#                      (dump only the following BUFR subtypes in BUFR type 001:
#                       subtypes 003, 010 and 013)
#
#        This will be referred to as the "data group message type/subtype" case
#        from here on.
#
#     The data group mnemonic case is most commonly used.
#
#     {NOTE1: A particular BUFR type/subtype in the resultant list to be dumped
#             can be skipped over via variable "SKIP_<TTTSSS>" (see below)}
#     {NOTE2: One or more BUFR types/subtypes not in the resultant list to be
#             dumped can be added via variable "ADD_<DGRP>" (see below)}

#   DTIM_earliest_<TTTSSS> - if BUFR message type TTT, subtype SSS is in the
#    resultant list to be dumped (for either the data group mnemonic or data
#    group message type/subtype case), then it will use this as the offset
#    value (in hh<.hh>) from the center time specified in the first script
#    positional parameter to obtain the earliest report time in the output
#    dump.  A negative value means prior to the center time and a positive
#    value means after the center time.  {If DTIM_earliest_<TTTSSS> does not
#    exist for a particular BUFR type/subtype in the list to be dumped, then
#    the default time window radius value, passed in via the second script
#    positional parameter (see above), is used.}
#    Example:
#                  export DTIM_earliest_000007=-2.1
#                  dumpjb 2014062312 1.5 adpsfc
#
#               Here, for METAR reports (000007) in the "adpsfc" dump, the
#               earliest reports dumped will be 2.1 hours PRIOR to the center
#               time (2014062312) and the latest reports dumped will be the
#               "default" 1.5 hours after the center time. All other BUFR
#               types/subtypes currently defined under the data group adpsfc in
#               $LIST will be dumped using the default time window of 1.5 hours
#               prior to the center time (earliest) to 1.5 hours after the
#               center time (latest).
#
#   DTIM_latest_<TTTSSS> - if BUFR message type TTT, subtype SSS is in the
#    resultant list to be dumped (for either the data group mnemonic or data
#    group message type/subtype case), then it will use this as the offset
#    value (in hh<.hh>) from the center time specified in the first script
#    positional parameter to obtain the latest report time in the output dump.
#    A negative value means prior to the center time and a positive value means
#    after the center time.  {If DTIM_latest_<TTTSSS> does not exist for a
#    particular BUFR type/subtype in the list to be dumped, then the default
#    time window radius value, passed in via the second script positional
#    parameter (see above), is used.}
#    Example:
#                  export DTIM_latest_002007=-1
#                  dumpjb 2014062306 2.5 proflr
#
#               Here, for NPN wind profiler reports (002007) in the "proflr"
#               dump, the latest reports dumped will be 1.0 hours PRIOR to the
#               center time (2014062306) and the earliest reports dumped will
#               be the "default" 2.5 hours prior to the center time. All other
#               BUFR types/subtypes currently defined under the data group
#               proflr in $LIST will be dumped using the default time window of
#               2.5 hours prior to the center time (earliest) to 2.5 hours
#               after the center time (latest).
#
#   DTIM_earliest_<DGRP> - if DGRP is a data group in the list to dump (data
#    group mnemonic case) or is a BUFR message type (data group mnemonic or
#    data group message type/subtype case), then works like
#    DTIM_earliest_<TTTSSS> defined above, except all BUFR message types and
#    subtypes in the resultant list to be dumped are affected.
#    Example:

#                  dumpjb 2014062312 1.5 adpsfc
#
#               Here, for all BUFR types/subtypes currently defined under the
#               data group adpupa in $LIST, the earliest reports dumped will be
#               2.1 hours PRIOR to the center time (2014062312) and the latest
#               reports dumped will be the "default" 1.5 hours after the center
#               time.
#
#   DTIM_latest_<DGRP> - if DGRP is a data group in the list to dump (data
#    group mnemonic case) or is a BUFR message type (data group mnemonic or
#    data group message type/subtype case), then works like
#    DTIM_latest_<TTTSSS> defined above, except all BUFR  message types and
#    subtypes in the resultant list to be dumped are affected.
#    Example:
#                  export DTIM_latest_satwnd=0.5
#                  dumpjb 2014062312 3.0 satwnd
#
#               Here, for all BUFR types/subtypes currently defined under the
#               data group satwnd in $LIST, the latest reports dumped will be
#               0,5 hours AFTER the center time (2014062312) and the earliest
#               reports dumped will be the "default" 3.0 hours prior to the
#               center time.
#
#    (NOTE1: For the pair DTIM_earliest_<TTTSSS> and DTIM_earliest_<DGRP> or
#            for the pair DTIM_latest_<TTTSSS> and DTIM_latest_<DGRP>, the
#            value specified in DTIM_*_<DGRP> always takes precedence.)
#    (NOTE2: This script will exit with condition code 99 if the calculated
#            earliest report time is LATER than the calculated latest report
#            time.)
#
#   SKIP_<TTTSSS> - if BUFR message type TTT, subtype SSS is in the resultant
#    list to be dumped (for either the data group mnemonic or data group
#    message type/subtype case), and SKIP_<TTTSSS> is of length 1 or greater
#    (regardless of its value), this type/subtype will be skipped (i.e., not
#    dumped).  (If SKIP_<TTTSSS> does not exist for a particular BUFR type/
#    subtype in the list to be dumped, then this type/subtype will be dumped.)
#    Example:
#                  export SKIP_000007=YES
#                  dumpjb 2014062312 1.5 adpsfc
#
#               Here, METAR reports (000007) are not processed as part of the
#               "adpsfc" dump even though they are included in the subtypes
#               defined for adpsfc in $LIST.
#
#   ADD_<DGRP>
#            - if DGRP is a data group in the list to dump (data group mnemonic
#    case) or is a BUFR message type (data group mnemonic case), then the
#    contents of ADD_<DGRP> are interpreted as a sequence of individual BUFR
#    message type (TTT) and subtype (SSS) strings in the form TTTSSS (separated
#    by white space) which are appended to those originally defined for DGRP in
#    the bufr_dumplist fixed file ($LIST). These additional BUFR message types/
#    subtypes will be dumped as part of DGRP.
#    Example 1:
#                  export ADD_satwnd="005019 005080"
#                  dumpjb 2014062312 1.5 satwnd
#
#               Here, GOES shortwave 3.9 micron winds (005019) and AVHRR POES
#               IR winds (005080) will be included in the "satwnd" dump along
#               with all of the subtypes defined for satwnd in $LIST.
#    Example 2:
#                  export ADD_002=002195
#                  dumpjb 2014062318 3.0 002
#
#               Here, BUFR message type 002, subtype 195 (which currently is
#               not defined in $LIST but might be defined for a test BUFR tank)
#               will be included in the "002" dump along with all of the
#               subtypes defined for type 002 in $LIST.  (Since all operational
#               subtypes are defined in $LIST, this would only be plausible
#               when pointing to a test BUFR tank.)
#
#            - if DGRP is a BUFR message type (data group message type/subtype
#    case), then the contents of ADD_<DGRP> are interpreted as a sequence of
#    individual BUFR message subtype (SSS) strings in the form SSS (separated
#    by white space) which are dumped in addition to those originally in the
#    resultant dump list for the applicable BUFR message type.
#    Example:
#                  export ADD_005="070 071"
#                  dumpjb 2014062312 1.5 005 010 012
#
#               Here, BUFR message type 005, subtypes 070 (MODIS POES IR winds)
#               and 071 (MODIS POES WV imager winds) will be included in the
#               "005" dump along with specified subtypes 010 (GOES IR winds)
#               and 012 (GOES visible winds).  (Since all subtypes wanted are
#               already explicitly defined in dgrp2, ... , dgrpN in this case,
#               this use of ADD_<DGRP> doesn't seem to ever be plausible.

#
#   TANK_<TTTSSS> - if BUFR message type TTT, subtype SSS is in the resultant

#                   to each subtype.  For this reason, a dump of any one of
#                   these databases alone or some combination of the databases
#                   (e.g., group mnemonics "rd2w04", "rd2r21" or "nexrad")
#                   spanning two days need only process one database file
#                   (e.g., a dump with center time 2005052100 and radius 1.5
#                   hours need only process the database file containing data
#                   for 20050520 for 22 and 23Z data, and 20050521 for 00, 01
#                   02Z data - the logic has been changed to handle this
#                   since normally with the 24-hour tanks a dump with this
#                   center and radius value would have to process two database
#                   files, 20050520 and 20050521)
#             + - If there are two database files being windowed {e.g., the
#                   dump center time is 2005052100 and the radius is 1.5 hours
#                   and the BUFR type/subtype is NOT 006/xx010-xx033 or
#                   006/xx040-xx063 (see $ above)} then DUMPMD must always be
#                   executed (even if it is imported as something other than
#                   "on") because it must combine the two database files into
#                   one windowed file
#             % - If FORM=copy then DUMPMD must always be executed (even for
#                   BUFR type/subtype 006/xx010-xx033 and 006/xx040-xx063)
#                   because in this case COMBFR is NOT executed and DUMPMD
#                   must then write the two dummy messages containing the dump
#                   center and processing times, respectively, to the top of
#                   the windowed file (the writing of the dummy messages has
#                   otherwise been moved from DUMPMD to COMBFR except for this
#                   case where COMBFR does not run)
#             Normally DUMPMD should NOT be imported by this script (i.e.,
#               allow it to default "on") so that the 24-hour database files
#               can be properly windowed by the DUMPMD and the 1-hour database
#               files (BUFR type/subtype 006/xx010-xx033 and 006/xx040-xx063)
#               can skip over this processing (unless FORM=copy) to save
#               valuable wall-clock time in their dump processing.
#   DUPC      - turns off duplicate check                           (default:on)
#   DUPC_TAC  - when "on", enables TAC v BUFR duplicate checking    (default:on)
#   TIME_TRIM - turns off time window trimming in duplicate check code
#                                                                   (default:on)

#   Geographical filtering of the data
#   ----------------------------------
#   LALO   -  Geographical data filter.
#             Set to either a rectangular lat/lon box where:
#              LALO=sssnnneeewww  where sss=southern latitude limit in degrees
#                                           (N+, S-)
#                                       nnn=northern latitude limit in degrees

#                                           (0.-360. West)
#      e.g.,  LALO=" 10 50 70120"  dumps everything in the rectangle bounded by
#                                  10-50 degrees North latitude by 70-120
#                                  degrees West longitude (note that quotes

#                                       xxx=longitude in center of circle in
#                                           degrees (0.-360. West)
#                                       ddddd=radius for circle filter in km
#      e.g.,  LALO="045269 6500C"  dumps everything in a circle of radius 6500
#                                  km centered at 45 degrees North latitude and
#                                  260 degrees West longitude (note that quotes
#                                  are needed if leading zeroes are not
#                                  specified)
#
#             -- or --
#
#             Set to a mask file where:

#                         grid spacing is 0.5 deg
#                         integer*4 with dimension mask(720,361)
#                         mask(1,1) is at 0.0 E lon, 90.0 S lat
#                         mask(720,1) is at 359.5 E lon, -90.0 S lat
#                         mask(1,361) is at 0.0 E lon, 90.0 N lat
#                         mask(720,361) is at 359.5 E lon, 90.0 N lat
#                         mask(i,j) = 0 --> grid point is outside domain
#                         mask(i,j) = 1 --> grid point is inside domain
#      e.g.,  LALO="F/nwprod/fix/nam_expdomain_halfdeg_imask.gbl"
#                                  dumps everything inside the 0,5 deg lat/lon
#                                  mask specified in the file
